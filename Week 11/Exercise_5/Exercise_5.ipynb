    "## 5. Modern Music Players\n",
    "\n",
    "The record and cassette players are old-school music players.\n",
    "More modern players have new features that can be used by users, such as having a list of songs and playing them independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise create the `ModernPlayer` class that inherits from the `MusicPlayer` class (created in exercise 3). \n",
    "This modern player will get all the music player attributes (`name`, `data_format`, and `state`), plus the `songs` attribute as parameters. The `songs` attribute is a list of strings representing the titles of the songs. It will also have the `current_song` attribute upon initialization, which will keep track of the current song being played. It should start by pointing to the first item on the list (recall how to index the first item on the list in Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the `ModernPlayer` class has the following two methods:\n",
    "- `next_song()`: this method changes the position of the current song to the next song in the list. For instance, if the current song is at position 0, then this method will change the position to 1, thereby representing the next song. If the current song is the last song and we use this method, it should point to the first song afterwards, i.e. starting all over again.\n",
    "- `play_current_song()`: this method returns the title of the current song of the `songs` attribute. Consider the attribute you created previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Investigate how to use the `super()` statement, when defining the constructor of the `ModernPlayer` class.\n",

    "**Example:**  \n",
