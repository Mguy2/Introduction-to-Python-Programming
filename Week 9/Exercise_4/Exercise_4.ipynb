One is a list of prices for different resorts per night, and the other is a list containing values of either 0 or 1, which represents whether it is possible to spot blacktip reef sharks in the vicinity of the resort.

For instance, if the first resort in the lists costs 230 USD per night and it has blacktip reef sharks in the surrounding beaches, the first data pair will be (230, 1).

    "Functions can have all possible variable types (e.g., *integers*, *floats*, and *strings*) and other functions as parameters. **But functions can also take objects as parameters**. We will create a function that takes objects as parameters and produces a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, create a function called `distance()`, which accepts two points (objects of type `Point`) and returns the euclidean distance between them. \n",
    "In order to test your function works as expected, use the two `Point` variables called `point_1` and `point_2` created in the previous exercise, and observe the result of `distance(point_1, point_2)` when you execute the cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** \n",
    "- Function `distance()` does not print anything, but **returns the euclidean distance between two points in 2D**.\n",
    "- `sqrt()` function (from the `math` built-in module) should be used to get the square root of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: You can compute `x` to the power of `y` as `x ** y` in Python. For instance, `x` to the power of `3` can be calculated by `x**3`.\n",

    "Classes can have objects as attributes. For this exercise create a class called `Circle` containing a `center` and a `radius` as attributes. The `center` is represented by a `Point` object (previously defined in *Exercise 4*) and the `radius` by an *integer* value. These two attributes should get defined in the init method!\n",
