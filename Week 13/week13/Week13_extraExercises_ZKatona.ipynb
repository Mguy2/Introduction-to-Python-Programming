    "In this task, you will create a Python class called `Course`, which will be used to represent university courses. The class should have three instance attributes:\n",
    "* `name`, which is the name of the course (e.g., `\"Introduction to Python\"`), with the default value an empty string\n",
    "* `credits`, which is the number of credits awarded for the course (e.g., `6`), with the default value 0\n",
    "* `location`, which is the city in which the course is offered (e.g., `\"Amsterdam\"`), with the default value an empty string\n",
    "\n",
    "The class should also have a method called `theme`, which takes as argument a keyword in the form of a string and returns `True` if the keyword is present in the course name and `False` otherwise. (The keyword search should not be case-sensitive.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created this class, your next task is to define a function called `possibleMinor`, which takes as input a list of Course objects and returns `True` if these courses could constitute a minor together and `False` otherwise. The criteria for courses to be able to constitute a minor is the following:\n",
    "* The number of courses in the list should not be smaller than 5 or larger than 7.\n",
    "* The number of credits awarded for all courses together should be exactly 30.\n",
    "* The courses should all be offered in the same location.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use this function to print a message to show if a list of courses could constitute a minor together.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* you can define auxilliary functions (e.g., to count the overall number of credits in a list of courses), but you do not have to.\n",

    "* A project is always worth 6 credits, so each `Project` object should automatically store this value in its `credits` attribute without taking it as a parameter.\n",
    "* A project is always done in groups. Therefore, the `Project` class should have an additional attribute called `groupSize`, which stores the number of allowed members in the project group and has a default value of 2.\n",

    "Once you have created this class, imagine you want to search for given types of projects in a course catalogue. The course catalogue is in the form of a list of `Project` objects, and your task is to write a simple program which asks the user for a project theme (e.g., `\"systems\"`) and a group size (e.g., `2`) and prints the name of all project courses which fulfill these criteria from the course catalogue.
