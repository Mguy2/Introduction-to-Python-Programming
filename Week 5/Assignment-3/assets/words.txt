She said an obvious thing - that countries becoming undemocratic will be sanctioned - in a very tactless way… and in a wrong time. The new government hasn't been formed yet, nothing un-democratic has been done yet so what she said was completely inappropriate. It seemed like she didn't agree to the result of a member country's democratic election - I want to remember to you all that no coup d’etat occurred… and this international fear of a new dictatorship in Italy is groundless, so far.

Her personal opinion doesn't matter, she is the President of an EU institution and she should behave as such.

I think that the President of the European Commission should be always diplomatic, trying to ponder their words and put an end to divisions. Instead, she opened an unnecessary controversy in a period in which Italians have low level of trust towards the EU and in which many Italians believe that the head of government is often chosen just to please the EU (as it happened when the President of the Italian Republic strongly invited all political parties to support Mario Draghi as PM).

This growing mistrust of Italians towards the EU is dangerous. An Italexit would be a disaster for Italy, but also for the EU itself: after losing the UK, the EU can't afford to lose another big net contributor. In addition, Italy is a founding member, the place where the first European treaties were signed - we all can understand the “ideological” loss for the EU if Italy left.

I think that the President of the European Commission should be always diplomatic, trying to ponder their words and put an end to divisions.

In addition, Italy is a founding member, the place where the first European treaties were signed - we all can understand the “ideological” loss for the EU if Italy left.She said an obvious thing - that countries becoming undemocratic will be sanctioned - in a very tactless way… and in a wrong time.

I think that the President of the European Commission should be always diplomatic, trying to ponder their words and put an end to divisions.

In addition, Italy is a founding member, the place where the first European treaties were signed - we all can understand the “ideological” loss for the EU if Italy left.She said an obvious thing - that countries becoming undemocratic will be sanctioned - in a very tactless way… and in a wrong time.

I think that the President of the European Commission should be always diplomatic, trying to ponder their words and put an end to divisions.

In addition, Italy is a founding member, the place where the first European treaties were signed - we all can understand the “ideological” loss for the EU if Italy left.She said an obvious thing - that countries becoming undemocratic will be sanctioned - in a very tactless way… and in a wrong time.

I think that the President of the European Commission should be always diplomatic, trying to ponder their words and put an end to divisions.

In addition, Italy is a founding member, the place where the first European treaties were signed - we all can understand the “ideological” loss for the EU if Italy left.She said an obvious thing - that countries becoming undemocratic will be sanctioned - in a very tactless way… and in a wrong time.

I think that the President of the European Commission should be always diplomatic, trying to ponder their words and put an end to divisions.

In addition, Italy is a founding member, the place where the first European treaties were signed - we all can understand the “ideological” loss for the EU if Italy left.She said an obvious thing - that countries becoming undemocratic will be sanctioned - in a very tactless way… and in a wrong time.

Her personal opinion doesn't matter, she is the President of an EU institution and she should behave as such.

I think that the President of the European Commission should be always diplomatic, trying to ponder their words and put an end to divisions. Instead, she opened an unnecessary controversy in a period in which Italians have low level of trust towards the EU and in which many Italians believe that the head of government is often chosen just to please the EU (as it happened when the President of the Italian Republic strongly invited all political parties to support Mario Draghi as PM).

This growing mistrust of Italians towards the EU is dangerous. An Italexit would be a disaster for Italy, but also for the EU itself: after losing the UK, the EU can't afford to lose another big net contributor. In addition, Italy is a founding member, the place where the first European treaties were signed - we all can understand the “ideological” loss for the EU if Italy left.She said an obvious thing - that countries becoming undemocratic will be sanctioned - in a very tactless way… and in a wrong time. The new government hasn't been formed yet, nothing un-democratic has been done yet so what she said was completely inappropriate.
